# Contributing to the Sign-terpreter Project  

This document outlines the rules to follow when contributing to the project.  

## :hammer: **Working Flow**  
Our workflow is based on **two main branches**:  
- `main`  
- `some-other-branch` (development branches)  

All new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates should be developed on a dedicated branch before being merged into `main`.  

---

## :memo: **Commit Naming Rules**  
1. You are free to name your commits as you see fit on your working branch.  
2. When performing a **squash merge**, the commit message must be **clear and meaningful** in relation to the changes introduced.  

---

## :cactus: **Branch Naming Rules**  
The name of your branch must be **descriptive** and related to the feature, bug fix, or documentation update being worked on.  

Examples:  
:white_check_mark: `feature/real-time-translation`  
:white_check_mark: `fix/sign-detection-bug`  
:white_check_mark: `docs/update-readme` 

---

## :arrows_counterclockwise: **Branch Merging Policy**  
Since we follow a two-branch workflow, all **pull requests** must be addressed to the **`main`** branch.  

:pushpin: **Merging Conditions:**  
- **Minimum number of approvals before merging:** 2  
- **Merge strategy:** Squash merge  

---

## :eyes: **Code Review Process**  
Before merging a pull request into `main`, it must be reviewed by **two team members** (anyone from the team).  

:pushpin: **Review Criteria:**  
1. Code quality and readability  
2. Adherence to project best practices  
3. Tests and validation when necessary  
4. Documentation clarity if applicable  

## :symbols: Language 
All work on **Git and GitHub must be done in English** to ensure consistency with existing contributions.  
This includes **code comments, commit messages, pull request descriptions, and discussions**.
