## Datasets
To download the source datasets used for this project, run:
```ps
python -m download_datasets [-o <output_folder>] [-c <config_file>]
```
> `gdown` may refuse to download some parts of the dataset automatically. You will be prompted in the console with instructions to complete the download if it cannot finish on its own. If that's the case, simply follow the instructions in the console.
